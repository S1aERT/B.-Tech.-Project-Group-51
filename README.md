# B.-Tech.-Project-Group-51
A research-driven deep learning project for early prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. The pipeline integrates a UNet-based retinal layer segmentation model with a Transformer-based TransNet classifier to estimate Alzheimer’s risk from retinal biomarkers.
